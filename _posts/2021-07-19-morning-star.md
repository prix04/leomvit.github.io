The morning star<br>
Man turned him into Satan<br>
Symbolized and personified him as death<br>
And called him nothingness<br>
But its beauty remains unspotted<br>
He shines forever, even though called devil<br>

Satan is a phase, nature is the fact<br>
Human imagination lead to an act<br>
An act causing nature to rot<br>
Lucifer or the shining one, the caller of dour<br>
That's what they call him, sore!<br>

A thought turned into heaven<br>
A thought turned into hell<br>
Venus became sullen<br>
For illuminating man<br>
Goodness can be spotted in darke<br>
That's what human targe<br>
So they called morning star "THE SATAN"<br>

BUT, IS HE REALLY A SATAN?<br>
OR BEAUTY OF NATURE?<br>
A PLANET TRYING TO OUTSHINE SUN<br>

The brilliance of the morning star,<br>
Which eclipses all other stars<br>
The beginner of dawn, goes down with fall<br>
Down the hall, called the hell<br>
Tormenting human soul, in a darke well<br>
THE HELL<br>

Heaven fallen on earth is a darth<br>
Lucifer takes birth<br>
Lucifer is imagination of night<br>
But it's still so bright<br>
But it's still so bright<br>

Imagery out of the box, pictured planets as gods<br>
Glorifying caste and pitiful arts<br>
All led to creation of the Babylonian mark<br>
